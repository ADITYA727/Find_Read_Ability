 Bumped into this guy in the lobby  

 Thirty feet high 100 cloned biker buttmuscle and topped with razor wire coated in highgrade Florida bath salts

 Dude just stop 

 nah 

 never

 We forked it The new project is called Lineage and its the same team thats been building CM



 Im actually happy to rebrand Never really liked the personal association and I think a fresh start is in order

Thanks for all the support during this rough ride Time for the next adventure 

Disgusting

WTF

 It would need to be enabled in the modem by OP our platform supports it Dont know if this will happen

 Cyanogen Inc and CyanogenMod 

 In LiveDisplay settings you can make the screen any color you want 

Nightlies OTW this is a great device 

 Absolutely

 Right on

 Come have a drink with the crew

 NX500 with Linux

 To do what we do you have to be a little crazy on community and developing for CM 

 Will relay to the themes team

 These are important questions to ask I ask them too 

 We refactored it on top of app ops when Google released it though

 It is now but originally it was not

 I actually wrote PG two years ago in a direct response to an app developer lying about an optout

 Again they do not I cite PG because it would alert you if they did but they dont so it doesnt

 PR wouldnt confront an issue like this head on I do

 If getting paid to do what I love is selling out then yes Also we are hiring 

 sigh Im saying its optin and there is no scraping unless you agree PG would alert if so

 Its not released yet and it wont be in nightly builds only the commercial dist

 No but our dialer SDK will be This integration is only for the commercial version of our OS

 I am testing our integrated version not released yet but will try the regular one too

 I just tested it again and you are wrong Our version is using a lightweight service impl of TC that uses our new SDK

 They way we did it is completely optional and optin And the app side will be open source

 They dont pull it if you opt out we would see a notification from PG if so Sorry if I burst your bubble

 Actually they dont or we would see a PG notification when you clicked no The whole thing is optional

 Thats a loaded question So is Google Facebook and half the apps on your phone

 They cannot if Privacy Guard is enabled

 My response 

 Release 38 upcoming has ANT support

 its in Settings It also prompts you during the initial setup

 very soon

 almost forgot MC via dialup wow Ancient history 

 

 RoP MPV Everwar how many hours did we sink into that 

 

 Awesome 

 

 

 classic 

 Big props to the Futex vulnerability used in TowelRoot is already fiex on the One Plus One

 OnePlus One 16GB Silk White 299 USD unlocked and without contract 

 congrats 

 aaaaaany day now guys this is completely unaeptable

 Not really Some of the things you can do with profiles cant be done by apps Would really like to improve that feature

Unboxing the OnePlus One 

 request 5120611 Thanks

 Probably my fault from the new RIL stuff we had to do I think its fixed now though

 I havent been able to log in for weeks Opened a support issue but no response Whats up

 Possibly due to the big RIL upgrade Will look into it File a JIRA if there isnt one

 What did you need

Looking forward to what these guys might surprise us with 

Getting ready at the event in Beijing 

 just tried it and couldnt reproduce a crash but it hung trying to get a location Could you paste a logcat of the crash

 We have long abandoned the permissionrevoking way Our current impl is based on app ops Do you have a repro case on cm11

 Unboxing my new Oppo N1 preinstalled with Cyanogen 

 broken how It works great

 Thanks guys Been a long time

Oppo N1 CyanogenMod Edition 

 It can be a little surreal sometimes

 Seattle

 we have a few things to add to that list

Do you love Android and want to be a part of something epic 

Go forth and void thy warranty 

 Is anyone else as frustrated as I am trying to convey how blowyourtitsoff awesome this news is to normals

 Open source Android firmware developer Cyanogen announces funding round led by 

Moment of truth is here 

 Its been the same story for as long as I have known him

 Wow Entropy has really lost it this time

 Direct CM Aount and future release process A glimpse into what weve been working on and whats to come 

 That said were soon going to be providing user builds private keys along side the userdebug test keys builds

 The signing keys issue is a tradeoff between hackability and security Changing keys requires wiping out your data

 Yeah you have a point Well fix it

 What device

 hahah no I want to see more people do interesting things with the framework

 with 8gb of ram and 256gb storage is it bedazzled out of the box

 Haha nah thats just trolling

 Were working on it

oO 

 wonder how that tastes if you mix them together

 yes

CM101 cometh 

 there will be an option to turn it on by default essentially requiring you to optin to apps that use personal data

 Sure thing shoot me an email

 Its quite a big undertaking and since it uses IMS we would need some help from 

 Cydia Substrate is for making changes to the stock ROM its not a replacement like CM

 Umm I am typing this from CM on S4

 Its awesome stuff but totally unnecessary on CM where you can just compile the whole thing yourself

 the stuff currently on github wont get you a working build but Ill get it up there soon

 Everything works now will upload repos later today

 It would take a lot of expensive infrastructure were a high traffic project

 Sure both are terrible options

 Were kind of on the fence at this point and I dont think every project is currently replicated there

Were hosting a drinkup for hackers in Seattle on May 2 

 Not even close

 Soon

 There are still issues with supporting Exynos4 devices Significant progress has been made lately though

 Yeah we are merging new features now that the code freeze is over Expect breakage in nightlies

CM101M2 has made an appearance on our download mirrors enjoy 

 ahh the good old days

 I do but I think that one belongs to I have a black RAV4 with a CId sticker on the back window

First builds of 101 are here 

 Yeah Were about to bring back the monthly builds now that 101 is pretty solid

2013 goal for CM 20 million users Happy New Year

 Worst technique ever Reported asshole

 Im pretty sure it would be exactly 8 liters

 we catch it in WindowManagerService and send an intent Can only be done by changing the framework

 Yeah Shiros was epic for sure

 Not necessary The story is long and were professionals

 lol that was a long time ago who were you on there i remember everyone pretty well at least by their nick

We have our domain back and everything was resolved amicably More info on the way Lets just forget about this

 nah getcm is just taking a bit of a beating due to our 100 stable release

So yeah its from now on And of course getcm

Strange things are afoot at the 

CM 10 M2 builds coming your way 

 pretty cool idea but not much room left on the status bar Maybe in the notification drop down



 last one 

 angry loggercat 

Most excellent the ultimate logcat 

 Only 4 days remaining in the worldwide and Google Nexus 7 giveaway competition Youve 

 Im not sure The 7x30based devices are seeing some progress but there are still issues

 We want to do a proper stable release quarterly considering that Android is updated every six months

 Its coming soon

 Yeah these are in addition to nightlies

 I9100G is in this round I9100 has a few minor issues right now

 We wanted to have something that resembles a stable build so that we can take bug reports

 As far as I know yeah

 Soon We dont have compatible graphics drivers yet

What do you think about the monthly release plan for CM I hope its a good balance of quality vs quantity

Our first CM10 release kinda 

 right they got it from us and we got the fix from Qualcomm

 yeah those are fine Galaxy S3 and all of the others are not working

 yeah because I have no effin idea at this point Everything should be working from the CM side

anyway you dont have to tweet at me just shoot me an email The crash is really weird and I cant debug it

Any engineers from out there who can help solve the issue with the app on CM10

CM9 stable builds rolling out now

 code it and send a patch You can post on our Google code page too

 We did a long time ago The USA models are called d2

 The international models have a completely different chipset so no guarantee based on that The team is working on it though

 Im really not sure I dont notice any real dip in performance It might be more noticeable on crappier hardware

 its not an inefficiency really Qualcomm just came up with a really good general Dalvik optimization that they dont share

 maybe theyll open up more stuff with their jb release well see soon I guess

 if you browse CAF youll find all this stuff they link proprietary static libs into a bunch of places

 and stock doesnt have the krait memory patches Theres also secret skia stuff on stock

 part of it is opensource but it relies on a static lib that isnt available

 the stock ROM has secret sauce from Qualcomm that speeds up some Dalvik stuff We dont have that code

 Sounds awesome but Ill be out of town

See you at 

 cameras are device specific As a general rule we wont release for a device if all the hardware isnt working

 I proposed that a year ago Got shot down Its a well known brand now messing with that would be stupid

On the way to CM9 

 yup 

 you might find unofficial builds of 9 for the N1 Right now it wont pass the CTS so we wont be releasing for it yet

 yeah but the vibrator will be stuck on permanently

 both

 at least some of Linaros work will be in there

 eventually Weve had problems with the camera on that class of devices

 yeah Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus are the top of the list

 is that even a question 

 or cherrypicking us and calling it finished 

More details later this week 

The most stable devices will get the RC first The system weve put in place should allow other devices to catch up quickly

 weve been doing weekly updates on Google

Guess what Its not that easy We dont just call something stable unless we mean it Also RC1 is soon

CM has been getting a lot of crap lately for taking so long with a release

 um yeah 

 we are working with the linaro guys to resolve the issues

 sure will

 set the recovery color format and try the graphicsc in samsungmsm8660common

 tried it but I am not convinced that building with g 47 is ready for prime time yet

And heres the revised CM9 boot animation by 

 its already in the works

 yeah it was fun We need to get everyone around here together more often

 I know I have been neglecting my Twitterly duties lately 

Oh wow 100k followers HI

 dunno about shirts but I am the proud owner of an AOKP screen cleaner now

CM9 nightly builds are live More targets are on the way 

New build servers online 

NICE 

Say hi to Cid 

 ohai 

 yeah i really just use G these days

Good stuff happening at Rootz via 

 CyanogenMod720RC1 is upon us 

A quick update on the status of CM nightlies and build server situation 

 yes for sure we are in the process of formalizing a lot of things

 No need for a panic Im working on it

 Wish the site worked with organizations

Trying to cheat the system so I can check out my geek cred via
