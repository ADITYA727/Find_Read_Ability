 Because the MyTaxi app wont

I love Las Vegas taxi drivers Theyve seen it all and every one has a story 

  My heart breaks over the entire nightmare situation  Thoughts are with you all

 That jetlag tho

 Thank you Hope the thought of CES doesnt bring back nightmares

CES is a long tough rewarding scramble I love giving myself time to settle in and get my bearings before it all kicks off

 Its easy nodrama You dont feel castigated every time you ask a question or charged 2 

 I feel like once you slap a case on it and realize you love the pics you get over it There are more 

 Im relieved to hear that How about the lizard earrings

Too bad I really want to see this with my own eyes gtgt The unbelievable 350 Escobar foldable phone wont be showin
