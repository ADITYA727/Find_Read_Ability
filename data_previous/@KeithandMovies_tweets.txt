 Of all the Joker scenes I think the bathroom dance is the legit 

 Same here FINALLY seeing it Thursday

 This isnt the first time Ive seen this happen And its really frustrating 

 I sense a trend

 As you should Its a well deserved nomination and something you should absolutely be proud of I know I would Congrats

 I just dont get the love for that film So much of it felt generic and rehashed from other teen raunchy comedies

The Writers Guild of America nominate some really good screenplays and Booksmart 

 Wendy

As usual here are a few Random Thoughts on last nights awards 

 Interesting I thought the performance was full of quite thoughtful touches 

Starting to see the if its not my one specific choice for Best Picture its a bad choice positioning as we head towards the Oscars 

 I dont pay that much attention to the hosts anyway All about the movies for me

 I didnt think the movie was great But I did think Zellweger was terrific

Random Thoughts on the 2020 Golden Globes 

 I picked ROS only because I watched Little Women and Uncut Gems before Christmas break 

 I used mute a couple of times Well once The other time I just went and made a sandwich I played with m 

 Hes pretty close All he needs to do is throw zip it into his repertoire

Jason Momoa dont need no tux  

Parasite wins Best Foreign Language film I loves The Farewell and really liked Les Miserables But it had to

Out of the last decade Ive only REALLY liked a couple of the Oscar Best Picture winners But this year there are s
