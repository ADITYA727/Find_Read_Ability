Listen to Bob Dylan singing Tangled Up In Blue here 

We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue

But me Im still on the road Headin for another joint

Some are mathematicians Some are carpenters wives Dont know how it all got started I dont know what theyre doin with their lives

So now Im goin back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know Theyre an illusion to me now

The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue

 Well my daddy was a fireman in a house out here She was the only daughter of the engineer

And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn

Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside

I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air

Pourin off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue

And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burnin coal

Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe I thought youd never say hello she said You look like the silent type

I must admit I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue

I muttered somethin underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face

She was standing there in back of my chair Said to me Dont I know your name

And later on as the crowd thinned out Is just about to do the same

She was workin in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept lookin at the side of her face In the spotlight so clear

I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind and I just grew Tangled up in blue

But all the while I was alone The past was close behind

So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I happened to be employed Workin for a while on a fishin boat Right outside of Delacroix

I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell

I heard her say over my shoulder Well meet again someday on the avenue Tangled up in blue

She turned around to look at me As I was walkin away

We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best

She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam I guess But I used a little too much force

Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows Ive paid some dues gettin through Tangled up in blue

And I was standin on the side of the road Rain fallin on my shoes

They never did like Mamas homemade dress Papas bankbook wasnt big enough

Her folks they said our lives together Sure was gonna be rough

Early one mornin the sun was shinin I was layin in bed Wondrin if shed changed at all If her hair was still red

Today Im going to sing Tangled Up In Blue

 There is a house in New Orleans They call the risin sun Its been the ruin of many a poor girl And me oh God Im one

Listen to Bob Dylan singing The Man In Me here 

Took a woman like you To get through to the man in me

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein seen But thats just because he doesnt want to turn into some machine

But oh what a wonderful feeling Just to know that you are near Sets my a heart areeling From my toes up to my ears

Take a woman like your kind To find the man in me

Storm clouds are raging all around my door I think to myself I might not take it any more

 And he spoke through his cloak most deep and distinguished And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance

 The peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him

 Heres to the hearts and the hands of the men That come with the dust and are gone with the wind

 Well I feel just like that rooster Honey ya treat me so unkind

 You walk the floor and wonder why With every breath you breathe

 Im seein your world of people and things Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings

Take a woman like you To get through to the man in me

The man in me will do nearly any task And as for compensation theres little he would ask

 The coldblooded moon The captain waits above the celebration

Today Im going to sing The Man In Me

 Throw my ticket out the window Throw my suitcase out there too

 I like to do just like the rest I like my sugar sweet But guarding fumes and making haste It aint my cup of meat

Listen to Bob Dylan singing Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands here 

My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul Oh who among them do you think could destroy you

Now you stand with your thief youre on his parole With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold

And your gentleness now which you just cant help but show Who among them do you think would employ you

With your sheetmetal memory of Cannery Row And your magazinehusband who one day just had to go

My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

 Stop all this weeping swallow your pride You will not die its not poison

And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms How could they ever ever persuade you

They wished youd aepted the blame for the farm But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm

But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side Oh how could they ever mistake you

 I seen her on the stairs and I couldnt help but follow Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil

Oh the farmers and the businessmen they all did decide To show you the dead angels that they used to hide

My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

 Nobody has to guess That Baby cant be blessed Till she sees finally that shes like all the rest

 Well I got the fever down in my pockets The Persian drunkard he follows me

 To her death is quite romantic She wears an iron vest Her professions her religion Her sin is her lifelessness

 But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts

 Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin Could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins

 I didnt do it he says and he throws up his hands I was only robbin the register I hope you understand

 Theres seven breezes ablowin All around the cabin door Theres seven breezes ablowin All around the cabin door

 And Big Jim was standin there ya couldnt say surprised Rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes

 When you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain

 And now I stand here lookin at your yellow railroad In the ruins of your balcony Wondring where you are tonight sweet Marie

 Hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know All the things that Im asayin an amany times more

 The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course The city fathers theyre trying to endorse

 Little rooster crowin there must be something on his mind Little rooster crowin there must be something on his mind

 No I do not feel that good When I see the heartbreaks you embrace If I was a master thief Perhaps Id rob them

 While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise

 Starin at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

 When I saw that my partner was just bein friendly When I took up his offer I musta been mad

 And Im just like that bird oh oh Singin just for you I hope that you can hear Hear me singin through these tears

 You cant take it with you and you know that its too worthless to be sold

 To fleshcolored Christs that glow in the dark Its easy to see without looking too far That not much Is really sacred

 But I know what he really loves you for Its your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat

 Once upon a time you dressed so fine You threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you

 I can follow the path I can read the signs Stay right with it when the road unwinds I can handle whatever I stumble upon

 Through this open world Im about to ramble Through ice and snows sleet and rain

 Oh the foes will rise With the sleep still in their eyes And theyll jerk from their beds and think theyre dreamin

 Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul

 If not for you Babe I couldnt find the door Couldnt even see the floor Id be sad and blue If not for you

 She takes just like a woman yes she does She makes love just like a woman yes she does

 And Madonna she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed

 And Rosemary on the gallows she didnt even blink The hangin judge was sober he hadnt had a drink

 You may be the heavyweight champion of the world You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls

 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin ship My senses have been stripped my hands cant feel to grip

 Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me Im not sleepy and there is no place Im going to

 For Halloween give her a trumpet And for Christmas buy her a drum

 Today on the countryside it was ahotter than a crotch I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch

 Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth Blowing down the backroads headin south

 I wouldnt pay it any mind its just a shadow youre Seein that hes chasing

 Oh the foes will rise With the sleep still in their eyes And theyll jerk from their beds and think theyre dreamin

 Youre the reason Im travlin on Dont think twice its all right

 His closest friends were black men cause they seemed to understand What its like to be in society with a shackle on your hand

 Now the rainman gave me two cures Then he said Jump right in The one was Texas medicine The other was just railroad gin

 That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain Of your useless and pointless knowledge

 Now you can train on down To Williams Point You can bust your feet You can rock this joint

 How she told me that one day we would meet up again And things would be different the next time we wed

 I wish shed unlock Her voice once an talk Stead of acting like we never have met

 I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form Come in she said Ill give you shelter from the storm

 And I could never let you go no matter what goes on Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone

 But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears Take the rag away from your face Now aint the time for your tears

 Now at midnight all the agents And the superhuman crew Come out and round up everyone That knows more than they do

 And you say Whats mine And somebody else says Where what is And you say Oh my God Am I here all alone

 But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But its alright Ma if I cant please him

 So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see They told him that he could identify the guilty men

 Knock knock knockin on heavens door Knock knock knockin on heavens door

 Wont you come with me baby Ill take you where you wanna go And if it dont work out Youll be the first to know

 How many roads must a man walk down Before you call him a man

And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs Who among them do you think could resist you

 Senor senor lets disconnect these cables Overturn these tables

 I dont cheat on myself I dont run and hide Hide from the feelings that are buried inside

 You say I let you down You know its not like that If youre so hurt Why then dont you show it

With your childhood flames on your midnight rug And your Spanish manners and your mothers drugs

 My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

 And your gentleness now which you just cant help but show Who among them do you think would employ you

 Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

 As he weeps to wicked birds of prey Who pick up on his bread crumb sins And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

 Well I ride on a mailtrain baby Cant buy a thrill Well Ive been up all night baby Leanin on the window sill

 May you grow up to be righteous May you grow up to be true May you always know the truth And see the lights surrounding you

And you wouldnt know it would happen like this But who among them really wants just to kiss you

 If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born Come in she said Ill give you shelter from the storm

 Im asingin you the song but I cant sing enough Cause theres not many men that done the things that youve done

 Could you ever be true I think of you and I wonder

 When you gonna wake up when you gonna wake up When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain

 You may be a construction worker working on a home You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss

 Aint that just like my heart babe When you kissed my lips

 My patron saint is afighting with a ghost Hes always off somewhere when I need him most

 You must think Im crazy I wouldnt let him do it for all the farms in Cuba

 Lie there lie there Love Henry she cried Till the flesh rots off your bones

My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

 The wind knocks my window the room it is wet The words to say Im sorry I havent found yet

 Knock knock knockin on heavens door Knock knock knockin on heavens door

Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

 Down the hallway footsteps were comin for the Jack of Hearts

 The peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him

 Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts

And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns Who among them would try to impress you

 Nobody can get no sleep Theres someone on evryones toes But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here Evrybodys gonna wanna doze

 He went to get the hangin judge but the hangin judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk

 There is a house down in New Orleans They call the risin sun Its been the ruin of many a poor girl And me oh God Im one

With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims

 Most of the time Im halfway content Most of the time I know exactly where it went

 Temptations page flies out the door You follow find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar

 Way out in the wilderness A cold coyote calls Way out in the wilderness A cold coyote calls

 People are crazy and times are strange Im locked in tight Im out of range I used to care but things have changed

 Mama take this badge off of me I cant use it anymore

And your basement clothes and your hollow face Who among them can think he could outguess you

 I met a young woman whose body was burning I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow

 An it aint no use in turnin on your light babe Im on the dark side of the road

 I got my black dog barkin Black dog barkin Yes it is now Yes it is Outside my yard

 Ah get born keep warm Short pants romance learn to dance Get dressed get blessed Try to be a suess

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace

 Oh your love comes on so strong And Ive waited all day long For tonight when Ill be staying here with you

 Hey Mr Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning Ill come followin you

 Girl by the whirlpool Lookin for a new fool Dont follow leaders Watch the parkin meters

My warehouse eyes my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or sadeyed lady should I wait

 Now you would not think to look at him But he was famous long ago For playing the electric violin On Desolation Row

 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street Where the neon madmen climb They all fall there so perfectly It all seems so well timed

Sadeyed lady of the lowlands Where the sadeyed prophet says that no man comes

And your flesh like silk and your face like glass Who among them do they think could carry you

With your pockets well protected at last And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass

And your silver cross and your voice like chimes Oh who among them do they think could bury you

With your mercury mouth in the missionary times And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes

Today Im going to sing Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands

 While them that defend what they cannot see With a killers pride security It blows the minds most bitterly

 Senor senor do you know where were headin Lincoln County Road or Armageddon

 She was born in spring but I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate

 Oh Mama can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again

Listen to Bob Dylan singing Ballad in Plain D here 

And I answer them most mysteriously Are birds free from the chains of the skyway

Ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me How good how good does it feel to be free

 Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound Her sister and I in a screaming battleground

 My mind it was mangled I ran into the night Leaving all of loves ashes behind me

I think of her often and hope whoever shes met Will be fully aware of how precious she is

 And Ezra Pound and T S Eliot Fighting in the captains tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers

 To see him obviously framed Couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game

 I didnt do it he says and he throws up his hands I was only robbin the register I hope you understand

 You may be a state trooper you might be a young Turk You may be the head of some big TV network

The wind knocks my window the room it is wet The words to say Im sorry I havent found yet

 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow

My mind it was mangled I ran into the night Leaving all of loves ashes behind me

 Im agoin back out fore the rain starts afallin Ill walk to the depths of the deepest black forest

All is gone all is gone admit it take flight I gagged twice doubled tears blinding my sight
